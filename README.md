## About

This project is based on [Adam Wr√≥bel](http://adamwrobel.com)
[JpegCamera](https://github.com/amw/jpeg_camera) library.

It was rewritten in JS ES6 and heavily changed, but most of the original logic stayed the same.

Docs will come soon...

The license stays the same and is located in LICENSE.md file.
