## About

This project is based on [Adam Wr√≥bel](http://adamwrobel.com)
[JpegCamera](https://github.com/amw/jpeg_camera) library.

It was rewritten in JS ES6 and heavily changed, but most of the original logic stayed the same.

Docs will come soon... The code is yet to be tested in production, and will probably receive some bugfixes. If really need some docs now, just give me a shout, otherwise stay tuned as this code is scheduled to go into production in around two-three weeks.

The license stays the same and is located in LICENSE.md file.
